This app is for groups to recommend hotspots such as places to visit, restaurants, events, etc.

A user can write reviews on local places for the public and followers to see

Other users can rate users higher or lower depending on the accuracy of their review
If a user gives a place a 5 star review, but it other users think that it was closer to 1 star, then they can downvote that user

Users who post reviews can be sorted like a leaderboard to see more reliable reviews

Users can be placed into categories for different types of reviews - Food reviewers, concert reviewers, event reviewers, camping reviewers

Types of places can also be searched for based on reviews and the reliability of the reviewers. If someone has given an unreliable review or is an unreliable reviewer then that user/review can be filtered out from the result/total

Reviews can have a rating out of 5 stars, a description, photos/videos, user key
Users can have a name, bio, follower count, follower list, following list, category, average reliability rating out of 10
